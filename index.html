            <h2>Carbohydrates</h2>
                <p>A carbohydrate is a naturally occurring compound, or a derivative of such a compound,
                    with the general chemical formula Cx(H2O)y, made up of molecules of carbon (C),
                    hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O). Carbohydrates are the most widespread organic substances 
                    and play a vital role in all life. Carbohydrate, class of naturally occurring compounds and derivatives formed from them. 
                    In the early part of the 19th century, substances such as wood, starch, and linen were found to be composed mainly of 
                    molecules containing atoms of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O) and to have the general formula C6H12O6; other 
                    organic molecules with similar formulas were found to have a similar ratio of hydrogen to oxygen.
                    The chemical formula of a carbohydrate is Cx(H2O)y, 
                    which denotes some carbons (C) with some water molecules (H2O) attached—hence the word carbohydrate, 
                    which means “hydrated carbon".</p>

            <h2>Fats and oil</h2>
    
                <p>Fats and oils are important sources of energy in the human diet. 
                    They also play a role in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, 
                    such as vitamins A, D, E, and K. Structurally they are esters of glycerol with three fatty acids 
                    (called either triacylglycerols or triglycerides).  It is these fatty acids that give the functionality to fats.  
                    Chemically, they can be divided into four main types saturated, cis-monounsaturated, cis-polyunsaturated and trans fatty 
                    acids.  In very broad terms, saturated fatty acids and trans fatty acids are solid at room temperature while the 
                    cis-unsaturates are liquid at room temperature.
                    Fats and oils are both lipids, which are organic compounds that are insoluble in water. 
                    They are composed of a molecule of glycerol and three fatty acids. 
                    The difference between fats and oils is that fats are solid at room temperature, 
                    while oils are liquid at room temperature</p>

            <h2>Fibre</h2>
            <p>Fibre is the blanket term given to the non-digestible, mainly carbohydrate material,
              found in plants.
              It is the part of the plant which our digestive enzymes cant break down, 
              so it passes through our digestive system relatively unchanged. Fiber or fibre (British English; from Latin: fibra[1]) is a natural or artificial substance that is significantly longer than it is wide.[2] Fibers are often used in the manufacture of other materials. The strongest engineering materials often incorporate fibers, for example carbon fiber and ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene.</p>

                        <dt>Avocado</dt>
                        <dd>A bright green fruit with a large pit and dark leathery skin,  It is native to the Americas and was first
                            domesticated in Mesoamerica more than 5,000 years ago. Then as now it was prized for its large and unusually 
                            oily fruit. The tree likely originated in the highlands bridging south-central Mexico and Guatemala.
                            Its fruit, sometimes also referred to as an alligator pear or avocado pear, is botanically a large berry 
                            containing a single large seed. Sequencing of its genome showed that the evolution of avocados was shaped by 
                            polyploidy events and that commercial varieties have an hybrid origin.</dd>
                        <dt>Vegetables</dt>
                        <dd>They are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other animals as food. The original meaning is still 
                            commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter, including the flowers, 
                            fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds. An alternative definition of the term is applied somewhat arbitrarily, 
                            often by culinary and cultural tradition. It may exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits, flowers, 
                            nuts, and cereal grains, but include savoury fruits such as tomatoes and courgettes, flowers such as broccoli, and 
                            seeds such as pulses.</dd>
                        <dt>Raspberry</dt>
                        <dd>An edible soft fruit related to the blackberry, consisting of a cluster of reddish pink druplets. A raspberry is an 
                            aggregate fruit, developing from the numerous distinct carpels of a single flower. What distinguishes the raspberry 
                            from its blackberry relatives is whether or not the torus (receptacle or stem) "picks with" (i.e., stays with) the fruit. 
                            When picking a blackberry fruit, the torus stays with the fruit. With a raspberry, the torus remains on the plant, leaving a 
                            hollow core in the raspberry fruit.</dd>
                        <dt>Nuts</dt>
                        <dd>They are dry, single-seeded fruits that have high oil content. A nut is a fruit consisting of a hard or tough 
                            nutshell protecting a kernel which is usually edible. In general usage and in a culinary sense, a wide variety of 
                            dry seeds are called nuts, but in a botanical context "nut" implies that the shell does not open to release the 
                            seed (indehiscent).</dd>
                        <dt>Oats</dt>
                        <dd>It is a type of cereal grain from the poaceae grass family of plants. The oat (Avena sativa), sometimes called the 
                            common oat, is a species of cereal grain grown for its seed, which is known by the same name (usually in the plural, 
                            unlike other cereals and pseudocereals). Oats are used for human consumption as oatmeal and rolled oats. Oats are a nutrient-rich food 
                            associated with lower blood cholesterol and reduced risk of human heart disease when consumed regularly.[1] One of the most common uses 
                            of oats is as livestock feed.</dd>
